# rsa_encryption

This is an RSA Encryption/Decryption application that uses a text file named "message.txt" to encrypt the message inside message.txt and copy it into the encrypted message text file named "encrypted.txt"

The encrypted text will then be decrypted and copied into another text file named "decrypted.txt"
